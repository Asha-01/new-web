             <div>   <p class="para">Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin C and potassium. They're an excellent source of dietary fibre, which can help to maintain a healthy gut and prevent constipation and other digestion problems. A diet high in fibre can also reduce your risk of <b>bowel cancer</b>.Eating non-starchy vegetables and fruits like apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables may even promote <b>weight loss</b>. [1] Their low glycemic loads prevent <b>blood sugar</b> spikes that can increase hunger.

                At least nine different families of fruits and vegetables exist, each with potentially hundreds of different plant compounds that are beneficial to health. Eat a variety of types and colors of produce in order to give your body the mix of nutrients it needs. This not only ensures a greater diversity of beneficial plant chemicals but also creates eye-appealing meals.</p>
